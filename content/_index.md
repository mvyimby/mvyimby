## Yes In My Back Yard

We are Mountain View YIMBY, advocating for more housing in our city and beyond. We are pro-housing activists fighting for more inclusive housing policies and a future of abundant housing in Mountain View. We drive policy change to increase the supply of housing at all levels and bring down the cost of living in our thriving city.  

The San Francisco Bay Area is not “full” of too many people. It _is_ full of opportunity to create a dynamic economy and housing market that work for everyone. The housing shortage is a political problem: 
Zoning and other restrictions have prevented construction of enough places for people to live.  We want to fix this and make our community more welcoming and inclusive. Let’s legalize housing.
