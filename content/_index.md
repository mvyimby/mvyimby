## Yes In My Back Yard

We are Mountain View YIMBY, advocating for more housing in our city and beyond.
We are Mountain View residents and workers who seek solutions to our area’s
housing shortage.

The Bay Area is not “full.” This shortage is a political problem:
Zoning and other restrictions have prevented construction of enough
places for people to live.  We want to fix this and make our community
a more welcoming and inclusive one. Let’s legalize housing.

We are a chapter of [South Bay YIMBY], who work throughout Santa Clara County and [YIMBY Action], a 501(c)(4) statewide nonprofit organization (EIN 81-514-0915). We're also affiliated with the following pro-housing organizations: 
- [Peninsula for Everyone], who handle San Mateo County and the North Peninsula portion of Santa Clara County.  
- [California YIMBY], who are focused on Statewide legislation.
