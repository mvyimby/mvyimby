## Yes In My Back Yard

We are Mountain View YIMBY, agitating for more housing in our city and beyond.
We are Mountain View residents and workers who seek solutions to our area’s
housing shortage.

The Bay Area is not “full.” This shortage is a political problem:
Zoning and other restrictions have prevented construction of enough
places for people to live.  We want to fix this and make our community
a more welcoming and inclusive one. Let’s legalize housing.

We are affiliated with [South Bay YIMBY], who work throughout Santa Clara
County, [YIMBY Action], who are based in San Francisco, as well as, 
[Peninsula for Everyone], who handle San Mateo County.
