By January 31, 2023, the City of Mountain View must identify sites and policies for at least 11,135 new homes to be built between 2023 and 2031. The city does not have to build these homes directly, but it must make them feasible. These sites and policies will form the [Housing Element], which the City Council approves and the state certifies. [Failure] to create a compliant Housing Element disqualifies the city from state grants and can even go as far as suspend local land use power.

The Mountain View YIMBY Housing Element Working Group meets monthly during this process to identify sites and policies to enable those homes. This process is complicated, even for the most adept housing advocates. That's why we're committing to breaking down the content and making it more accessible for all. Join us at contact@mvyimby.com

## Mountain View Housing Needs Allocation
In a process called the Regional Housing Needs Allocation ([RHNA]), the state's Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) assigns minimum quotas to various regions based on projected growth, a targeted vacancy rate, existing overcrowding, expected demolitions, and historical cost-burdens. Our region, under the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), then assigned the quota to individual cities and counties based on projected growth, resource richness, proximity to jobs, and economic segregation. From this [plan], Mountain View is assigned:
* Very Low Income (<50% of Area Median Income): 2,773
* Low Income (50-80% of AMI): 1,597
* Moderate Income (80-120% of AMI): 1,885
* Above Moderate Income (>120% of AMI): 4,880

[Area Median Income] is specified at the county level by HCD annually. For 2021, Santa Clara County's AMI for a 4-person household is $151,300, compared to $141,600 the year before.
