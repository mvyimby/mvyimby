The City of Mountain View must identify sites and policies for 11,135 new homes, including 6,255 affordable, by January 31, 2023. We don't have to build or permit these homes by then - we have to demonstrate a willingness to make them feasible here. These sites and policies will be outlined in a document called a Housing Element, which the City Council must review and the state must certify. [Click here] to see what's at stake if we fail to create a Housing Element that can be certified by the state.

The Mountain View YIMBY Housing Element Working Group meets monthly during this process to identify sites and policies to enable those homes. This process is complicated, even for the most adept housing advocates. That's why we're committing to breaking down the content and making it more accessible.
