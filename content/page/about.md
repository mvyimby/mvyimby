We are Mountain View YIMBY, advocating for more housing in our city and beyond. We are pro-housing activists fighting for more inclusive housing policies and a future of abundant housing in Mountain View. We drive policy change to increase the supply of housing at all levels and bring down the cost of living in our thriving city. We support a full spectrum of new housing: supportive housing for the homeless, subsidized housing, social housing, even luxury condos!

The San Francisco Bay Area is not “full” of too many people. It _is_ full of opportunity to create a dynamic economy and housing market that work for everyone. The housing shortage is a political problem: 
Zoning and other restrictions have prevented construction of enough places for people to live.  We want to fix this and make our community more welcoming and inclusive. Let’s legalize housing.

## Our Mission
We support the YIMBY Action "[Core Four]":
* *Legalize housing*: Upzone to allow more housing in every neighborhood
* *Streamline Permitting*: Make housing permits fast and fair
* *Fund Affordable Housing*: Increase funding for low-income housing
* *Fix Broken Incentives*: Reform laws that incentivize communities to say no to new homes

## What YIMBY Means
YIMBY means "Yes In My Back Yard". The term gained its meaning in the
early 2000s in the SF Bay Area due to high housing costs. More information
about the general term can be found [here].  

## Our Organization
We are a chapter of [South Bay YIMBY], who work throughout Santa Clara County and [YIMBY Action], a 501(c)(4) statewide nonprofit organization (EIN 81-514-0915). We're also affiliated with the following pro-housing organizations:
