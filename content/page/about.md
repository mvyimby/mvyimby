We are Mountain View YIMBY, advocating for more housing in our city and beyond. We are pro-housing activists fighting for more inclusive housing policies and a future of abundant housing in Mountain View. We drive policy change to increase the supply of housing at all levels and bring down the cost of living in our thriving city.  

The Bay Area is not “full” of too many people. It _is_ full of opportunity to create a dynamic economy and housing market that work for everyone. The housing shortage is a political problem: 
Zoning and other restrictions have prevented construction of enough places for people to live.  We want to fix this and make our community more welcoming and inclusive. Let’s legalize housing.

We are a chapter of [South Bay YIMBY], who work throughout Santa Clara County and [YIMBY Action], a 501(c)(4) statewide nonprofit organization (EIN 81-514-0915). We're also affiliated with the following pro-housing organizations: 
- [Peninsula for Everyone], who handle San Mateo County and the North Peninsula portion of Santa Clara County.  
- [California YIMBY], who are focused on Statewide legislation.  

## What YIMBY Means
YIMBY means "Yes In My Back Yard". The term gained its modern meaning in the
early 2000s in the SF Bay Area due to high housing costs. More information
about the general term can be found [here].
