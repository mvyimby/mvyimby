Mountain View YIMBY is thrilled to endorse Emily Ramos for the open seat on the Mountain View City Council. As a dedicated leader of our organization for many years, Emily has a deep understanding of the city’s housing crisis and a proven track record of working towards creating more affordable housing options for Mountain View residents.

As a member of the Rental Housing Commision and the current vice-chair, Emily has been instrumental in implementing a law that protects 15 thousand families from significant rent increases and evictions. She also has experience as Preservation and Protection Associate at SV@Home, where she gained deep knowledge and experience with anti-displacement policies and as a board member of the Community Services Agency, where she helped connect residents to receive assistance to prevent them from losing their homes during the pandemic. Along with her work with YIMBY, she’s also a long-time member of the League of Women Voters housing committee. Furthermore, her engagement with many different groups, including community organizations, and her understanding of the city's government and current issues, positions her to be able to collaborate and work effectively with her fellow council members from day one.

Emily’s passion for improving the quality of life for Mountain View residents is reflected in her long-standing involvement in the community including as a board member for both the Community Services Agency and the Mountain View Historical Association. Congresswoman Anna Eshoo has also endorsed Emily, noting that she is “a dedicated housing advocate, consummate volunteer, and voice for vulnerable communities.” With her experience and dedication, Emily is well-positioned to tackle not only the housing crisis, but all issues facing the city. Mountain View YIMBY is confident that she will be an effective and dedicated council member, serving the best interest of all residents.
