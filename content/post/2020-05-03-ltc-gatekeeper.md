Dear Mayor Abe Koga and the members of council:  

We are excited to see the first project in the East Whisman Precise Plan area coming to council for approval!  
Thereâ€™s much to like about this project:  

* Located walking and biking distance to offices in the East Whisman neighborhood
* 427 much needed homes, including 157 missing middle ownership homes
* Addition of a 16000 sq foot public park
* Walking distance to Middlefield light rail station
* $4 million community benefit contribution ($1.5 million more than is required)  

We urge the council to expedite the approval of this project, ensuring it can continue forward.
