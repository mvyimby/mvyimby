Dear Mayor Abe-Koga and Members of the City Council:

MV YIMBY, a local volunteer advocacy group, expresses its wholehearted support of the proposed development at 1001 N Shoreline. This development will provide 303 much-needed new homes, close to major employers, with zero displacement and minimal impact on existing neighborhoods.

The site is walking distance from employers in Terra Bella and North Bayshore. For those residents who will work outside the area, it is conveniently located to Highway 101 and future transit routes to the downtown transit center. And, since the new buildings will replace a surface parking lot adjacent to an existing office building of similar height, they will only minimally affect the character of the neighborhood.

The developer has agreed to provide a compelling benefits package. First is a total of $6.8 million between a generous school fee, community benefit fee, land dedications and infrastructure. Second is a park fee of $15.8 million. The last piece is a package of below-market-rate housing with a monetary value of $35 million. The infrastructure component includes a sewer main much needed by the City to support ongoing development in North Bayshore.

Best regards,
The members of MV YIMBY
