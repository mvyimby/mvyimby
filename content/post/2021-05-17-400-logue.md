Dear Chair Cranston and members of the EPC:

Mountain View YIMBY, a local volunteer advocacy group, expresses strong support for Miramarâ€™s apartment project at 400 Logue Ave.

Please see the letter attached or the plain text version below.

This strategic location, in the thick of the East Whisman planning area and steps away from Middlefield light rail, is excellent for high-density housing. The 408 proposed new homes will help mitigate the jobs-housing imbalance of the adjacent Google Middlefield Park project.

We believe that Mountain View, as the source of much employment growth in recent years, urgently needs large new residential developments like this one. The proposed project displaces no existing residents, and replaces a one-story office building that is a wasteful use of prime real estate. The 62 BMR units will help Mountain View meet its RHNA quotas.

We hope that you recommend a hasty approval of this project to the council!

Thank you for considering our input.

Best regards,
Ilya Gurin
On behalf of the members of MV YIMBY
