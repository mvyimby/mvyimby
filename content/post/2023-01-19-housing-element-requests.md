Additionally, prevent new levels on fees from being a significant constraint on development, to be determined by per-fee feasibility studies. In this section, cumulative fees are understood broadly to include impact fees, in-lieu fees, community benefits payments, and TDM/TDA-related payments.</span></p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Objectives and Metrics</strong></span></p><ul><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Ensure city imposed fees are reasonable and not a significant constraint on development by capping per-unit cumulative fees at 100% AMI for a family of two.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Comply with the Mitigation Fee Act.</span></li></ul><p><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Milestone and Timeframe</strong></span></p><ul><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Finish review of existing fees, set new fees, and set maximum per-unit cumulative fees equal to 100% AMI for a family of two by December 31, 2024.</span></li><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Annual review after December 31, 2024 to conduct a feasibility study that encompasses each fee as well as the cumulative effect on feasibility of all fees taken together.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h3>1.15 Replacement of the Gatekeeper Process</h3><p><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Replace the Gatekeeper process with an ‘early consideration’ process, outlined as follows:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">For non-exempt requests for a zoning change, Precise Plan amendment or General Plan amendment, staff will request early consideration from city council on those requests provided the requests reasonably comply with constraints imposed by state law and the general plan. This early consideration from council will be provided within 90 days of the request and will provide staff with direction on whether to pursue further processing of the application. If the project applicant requests it, more than 90 days can be allotted for council to provide early consideration on a request.</span></li><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Requests will also be reviewed by council on the merits of the project taken on its own so that projects do not compete with each other.</span></li></ul><p><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Council will also expand the scope of requests that are automatically further processed by staff. Council will provide staff with a minimum set of requirements for housing projects that, if met, will greenlight staff to further process requests for a rezoning, precise plan amendment, or general plan amendment.</span></p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Eliminate the gatekeeper authorization process, which requires affirmative direction from the Council to submit an application, for residential or mixed-use projects with a significant residential component. The City will process applications for General Plan Amendments and rezonings with reasonable requirements and check-in points.</span></p><p><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Objectives and Metrics</strong></span></p><ul><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Allow the development community to propose projects that provide significant amounts of new housing. The City will annually report to HCD the size of the application queue for the ‘early consideration’ process and the number of non-exempt units approved through zoning changes, Precise Plan amendments, or General Plan amendments.</span></li></ul><p><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Milestone and Timeframe</strong></span></p><ul><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Transition to an ‘early consideration’ process by December 31, 2025</span></li><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Ensure all of the projects currently in the Gatekeeper process get heard by council by December 31, 2026 if the applicant requests it.</span></li></ul><h3>2.6 Affirmatively Further Fair Housing</h3><p>Continue to prepare and update the City's Assessment of Fair Housing and implement actions as necessary to remove barriers to fair housing choice, as required by HUD and State Housing Element law.</p><p><strong>Objectives and Metrics</strong></p><ul><li>Remove impediments to fair housing and provide equitable access to housing and opportunity.</li><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Plan to create housing choice in high opportunity areas to mitigate patterns of segregation. Housing choice will be measured by two metrics. First, the City will track the number of affordable units constructed South of the El Camino Precise Plan, with an objective to build at least 100 units of affordable housing there by July 31, 2027.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Create an educational equity target by 2024 as follows. The city will identify a percentage of the overall market-rate and affordable housing RHNA targets that should be built in each neighborhood or within each elementary school enrollment boundary. These percentages shall ensure that at least 33% of the RHNA is evenly allocated among these geographic boundaries (e.g., if using the 7 elementary school boundaries, at least 33% / 7 = 4.7% of the overall RHNA should get built in each school’s area).</span></li></ul><p><strong>Milestone and Timeframe</strong></p><ul><li>Update Assessment of Fair Housing as required by HUD with the first update completed in 2023, and subsequent updates based on HUD guidance.&nbsp;</li><li>Implement necessary actions continuously as needed.&nbsp;</li><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">If 100 units of affordable housing are not constructed South of the El Camino Precise Plan by July 31, 2027, the City will survey landowners South of the El Camino Precise Plan on regulatory barriers to housing development, forward the survey results to HCD, and request HCD’s reasonable recommendations on programs, including but not limited to streamlining and zoning reform, that would create more housing across the income spectrum South of the El Camino Real Precise Plan. The city will implement HCD’s reasonably recommended programs to the satisfaction of HCD by July 31, 2029.</span></li><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">By July 31, 2027, the City will identify whether at least half of the units required by the educational equity metric have been built and commit to additional programs (including SB 10 rezonings) if these targets are not met.</span></li></ul><h3>4.1 Development Streamlining and Processing Revisions</h3><p>Implement processing procedures and technology improvements that will reduce Planning and</p><p>Building Permit review timelines to address constraints resulting from the duration of staff review.</p><ol><li>Review and update the City's affordable Housing NOFA process to improve coordination and communication internally (e.g., coordination between Housing, Planning and other departments and internal processes in Planning and other departments) and with applicants. Encourage affordable housing developers to work with outside funding sources to leverage the City's local funds to the maximum extent possible. Initial steps in the review include additional developer roundtables, garnering consultant advice, and scanning other public agency processes for best practices. In addition, the City will continue to facilitate and support 100% affordable housing development in the review process, by allocating dedicated staff and utilizing streamlining opportunities. This responds to input received from affordable housing developers during the outreach process (see Chapter 1: Introduction, Public Participation section).</li><li>Review development and post-development processes, timelines, and approval body levels to streamline permitting processes. Adopt procedures that improve internal coordination and staff throughput. This responds to input received from market-rate housing developers during the outreach process (see Chapter 1: Introduction, Public Participation section). <span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Implement all high-priority recommendations from the Development Review Assessment (“Matrix Study”), including the development of a new permitting software system.&nbsp;</span></li><li>Acquire tools and software that will improve development review, monitoring of housing supply, management of funding, transparency of data and approvals, and other processes involved in housing development for staff and public use.</li><li><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Create a ministerial approval pathway by 2025 for approving applications for all projects that are code-compliant and meet the City's inclusionary requirements, provided an applicant has submitted all materials and requirements as stipulated under SB 330.</span></li></ol><p>In addition, Program 1.3 will streamline development review by improving the consistency,</p><p>transparency and relevance of the standards that affect residential development.</p><p><strong>Objectives and Metrics</strong></p><ul><li>Facilitate at least 1,100 units of 100% affordable development by streamlining the funding approval process, prioritizing staff review, utilizing State streamlining (e.g., SB35)</li><li>Reduce the number of resubmittals and time between application completeness and approval through process and approval body revisions</li><li>Bring the city fully into compliance with new transparency legislation by posting project-specific fees online.</li></ul><p><strong>Milestone and Timeframe</strong></p><ul><li>Bring City into full compliance with transparency requirements as soon as possible.</li><li>Review and update NOFA process by June 30, 2024.</li><li>Update the Zoning Ordinance process and approval bodies by December 31, 2026</li><li>Fully implement electronic review software by June 30, 2024.
