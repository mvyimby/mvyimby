Dear Senator Becker,  
  
MV YIMBY as an organization that advocates for transit-oriented development is a member of Voices for Public Transportation, a coalition of over 50 community-based organizations in the Bay Area that support a major investment in our public transportation system. We support developing a major regional transportation funding measure for the November 2024 ballot to create a more accessible and inclusive transportation system in the Bay Area.  More information can be found on the [website].   
  
Attached is a letter developed by Voices for Public Transportation calling for MTC to begin a public process to develop a transformative regional funding measure. As described in the letter, in order to be ready for a 2024 ballot measure a regional process should be initiated by January 2022. The letter also describes key priorities for a regional funding measure process, including prioritizing the voices of transit dependent riders.  
  
We invite you and other elected officials to join this sign-on letter alongside Voices for Public Transportation groups. We are seeking to submit the letter to MTC in July and would be grateful for your support.  
  
Thank you, and please let me know if you have any questions,  
  
Sincerely,  
  
Michael Abramson, on behalf of Mountain View YIMBY
