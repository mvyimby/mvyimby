To the residents of Mountain View,

Mountain View YIMBY is proud to announce our endorsements for the 2024 City Council elections. We are endorsing Pat Showalter, Chris Clark, Devon Conley, and Emily Ann Ramos—four candidates who have demonstrated their commitment to increasing housing supply, advocating for affordable housing, and making Mountain View a more inclusive and sustainable place to live.

### Pat Showalter

Pat Showalter has been a consistent YIMBY advocate during her multiple tenures on the Mountain View City Council. She is a strong supporter of policies that promote new housing development and remove arbitrary constraints on housing production. Pat’s technical background as a civil engineer has given her a deep understanding of how infrastructure and housing intersect, and she has used this knowledge to champion projects that will increase the housing supply in Mountain View. We are confident that Pat will continue to push for the housing solutions our city needs. Learn more at [patshowalter.com](https://patshowalter.com/).

### Chris Clark

Chris Clark’s prior experience on the City Council has shown him to be a reliable advocate for expanding Mountain View’s housing supply. During his previous tenure, Chris consistently supported new housing developments and fought to reduce barriers to construction. If re-elected, he plans to continue pushing for increased housing in key areas of the city, helping to ensure that Mountain View remains an affordable and vibrant place to live. We trust that Chris will remain a steadfast ally in our efforts to create more housing opportunities for everyone in Mountain View.

### Devon Conley

Devon Conley, a current member of the school board, has a strong record of supporting housing initiatives that benefit the community. As a school board member, she has been a vocal advocate for workforce housing to help teachers and other essential workers afford to live in Mountain View. Devon understands the housing challenges facing families and workers, and she is committed to expanding the city’s housing supply to improve affordability. Her focus on creating housing opportunities for all residents makes her an excellent candidate for City Council. Learn more at [devonconley.com](https://www.devonconley.com/).

### Emily Ann Ramos

We reaffirm our early endorsement of Emily Ann Ramos for Mountain View City Council. Emily has been a tireless advocate for increasing the supply of affordable and market-rate housing in Mountain View. Her extensive work in housing policy and her role in crafting the city’s housing element demonstrate her deep knowledge and commitment to addressing the housing crisis. Emily’s focus on tenant protections, anti-displacement strategies, and sustainable development makes her a crucial voice in shaping the future of housing in Mountain View.
