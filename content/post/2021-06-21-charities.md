To Mayor Kamei and members of the City Council  
  
Mountain View YIMBY is a chapter of South Bay YIMBY. We are a group of people who live or work in the city of Mountain View and believe in increasing equitable access to the opportunities offered by this amazing city, and combating global warming through urbanization. We do so by advocating for construction of homes at all income levels from supportive housing to market rate! We protect Mountain View’s more vulnerable residents by defending Mountain View’s rent control law, and advocating for better displacement protection policies. Last but not least, we push for more transit, and bike and pedestrian infrastructure.  
  
Therefore, Mountain View YIMBY expresses enthusiastic support for the new all-affordable housing development proposed by nonprofit developer Charities Housing. We applaud the proximity to another all-affordable development near downtown, the Caltrain station, and CSA.  
  
The 84 units proposed at 1265 Montecito Avenue will also have one third targeted to those who are extremely low income. Finally, we are excited that the development will be at maximum density therefore maximizing the amount of much needed homes.  
  
Thank you for considering our input.  
  
Kind regards,  
David Watson  
On behalf of the members of Mountain View YIMBY
