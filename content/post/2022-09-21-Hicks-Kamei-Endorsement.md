Mountain View YIMBY is excited to share our full set of endorsements for this year’s City Council elections.

## Ramirez

Mayor Lucas Ramirez [got our early endorsement](https://mvyimby.com/post/2022-07-21-ramirez-endorsement/) back in July.  As we wrote back then, Lucas has been a strong advocate for adding more homes in Mountain View. He championed [efforts to tackle the missing middle housing problem](https://www.mv-voice.com/news/2021/04/15/massive-zoning-overhaul-in-mountain-view-would-increase-density-potentially-adding-9000-new-homes), supported a local SB 330 ordinance to prevent displacement, [rent stabilization of Mountain View’s mobile home parks](https://www.mv-voice.com/news/2021/09/15/mountain-view-passes-rent-control-for-mobile-homes-capping-rents-across-citys-six-mobile-home-parks), and more! During his time on the council he voted for many housing projects. Check out [our early endorsement](https://mvyimby.com/post/2022-07-21-ramirez-endorsement/) post for all the details!

## Hicks

We strongly endorse Alison Hicks for Mountain View City Council. With a background in urban planning, Alison is passionate about urban design and reimagining public spaces to be joyful places for public life, best exemplified by Castro’s new pedestrian plaza. Alison pairs her degree in urban design with a heartfelt commitment to our least-resourced neighbors, as she demonstrates time and time again from being a champion for safe parking for RVs, COVID-19 rent relief, and the extension of rent control to mobile homes.

A consistent voice for ending the jobs-housing imbalance in Mountain View, Alison supports transit-oriented development near the Castro Caltrain station, bringing Mountain View’s costly parking requirements in closer alignment with Donald Shoup’s recommendations, and increasing staff capacity so the city can move faster on solving the housing crisis. Most impressively, even at city council meetings where NIMBYs protest a project like 555 W. Middlefield, Alison remains firmly pro-housing because she knows the jobs-housing imbalance is the root of displacement in our community. This is also why, in addition to supporting pro-housing policies, she has supported virtually every important project that has gone to council ([here's the full list](https://mvyimby.com/post/2022-07-21-ramirez-endorsement/)).

We highly recommend her as a strong voice for housing in Mountain View.  


## Kamei 

With her deep experience in all levels of government, we proudly endorse Ellen Kamei for re-election.  Ellen has lived in Mountain View most of her life, but also brings the broader perspective that comes with having lived abroad. 

Ellen supports making it easier to live in Mountain View without a car, as many residents already do. Ellen also supports state legislation, including SB 35 and AB 1763, that encourages cities to accept more homes, including Mountain View and our neighboring communities that are less housing-friendly.
