Mountain View YIMBY sends its regards to Mayor Adrian Fine of Palo Alto, who declined to seek re-election this year. Adrian, we wish you all the best in your future endeavors, and we will miss having you as an ally.

We share the sentiments Adrian expressed in [this interview with The Six Fifty] in October. (https://thesixfifty.com/palo-altos-outgoing-mayor-has-some-words-for-the-city-s-elected-officials-build-is-one-of-them-8c953be55e1c). We appreciate the shout-out to our city of Mountain View, but we need to keep up the momentum and keep up the pressure on our neighboring cities to build more!
