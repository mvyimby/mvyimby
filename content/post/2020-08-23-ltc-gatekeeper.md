Dear Mountain View City Council:

I am writing to support the gatekeeper development request (item 6.1 on [Tuesday's agenda](https://mountainview.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=790148&GUID=3BA719BC-193F-454D-91B9-7155AE0C5C14)). There are many families who live or work in Mountain View who desperately need (I do not use that word lightly) the proposed 105 below-market-rate units. Public Storage's proposed land donation is commendable, and would set a wonderful precedent of cooperation. And I'm sure that Council is already aware that the site is conveniently located near both employment centers and the future transit artery on Shoreline.  
  
Best regards,
